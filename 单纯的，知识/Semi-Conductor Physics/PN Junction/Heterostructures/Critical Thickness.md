There is a critical thickness $h_c$ below which the film grown is strained without misfit dislocation (pseudomorphic growth), and above which the film becomes unstrained or relaxed, associated with formation of misfit dislocations at the interface.

$$h_c=\frac{b}{8\pi(1+v)M}\left[ln\left(\frac{h_c}{b}\right)+1\right]$$
