If the growing SiGe film is thick enough, the heterostructure will be unstrained. In this case, the grown film and the substrate have their own bulk lattice constants. The two materials, SiGe film and Si substrate have cubic symmetry. That is, the cubic unit cell $a_f\cdot a_f\cdot a_f$ is for the film and $a_s\cdot a_s\cdot a_s$ is for the substrate.

In this case, the atoms of the film and the substrate do NOT have a one-to-one correspondence at the interface. 

This results in the formation of defects at the interface of the two materials, called misfit dislocations.
