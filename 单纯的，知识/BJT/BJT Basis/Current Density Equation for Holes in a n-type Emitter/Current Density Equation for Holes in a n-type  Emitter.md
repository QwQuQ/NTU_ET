By using the same method in [[Current Density Equation for Electrons in p-type Base]], the hole current density injected from the p-type base into the n-type emitter is:
$$J_p(x)=-qD_{p}\frac{n_{ie}^2}{n_{n}}\frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}x}\left(\frac{n_{n}p_n}{n_{ie}^2}\right)$$
The hole current density is given in terms of the electron and hole densities in the emitter.
